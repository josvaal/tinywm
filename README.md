# TinyWM

Port of TinyWM in Go.

## Usage

Make sure libx11-dev is installed

```
$ sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
```

Add the ```.desktop``` file to the xsessions directory. This will add a new selection to the list of window managers at the login screen. 

```
$ sudo cp tinywm.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/
```

This file runs /usr/bin/tinywm-session. Create that file now.

```
$ sudo cp tinywm-session /usr/bin/
$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/tinywm-session
```

tinwm-session preloads a terminal and then runs the go binary. Build the binary and move it to /usr/bin/.

```
$ go build tinywm.go
$ sudo mv tinywm /usr/bin/
$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/tinywm
```

Log out. You should now see tinywm as an option in the list. Choose it a log in. You should have a bare WM with a terminal emulator running.
